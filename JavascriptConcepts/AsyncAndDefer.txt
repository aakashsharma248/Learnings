// async: Scripts load in parallel and execute as soon as they are ready (non-blocking), but without guaranteed execution order.
// defer: Scripts load in parallel, but they execute only after the HTML parsing is complete and in the order they are defined.

// 1. The Default Behavior Without async or defer

//  <script src="script.js"></script> 

//  The browser stops parsing the HTML when it encounters the <script> tag.
//  It downloads and executes the script immediately before continuing to parse the rest of the HTML.
//  This is blocking, meaning it prevents the rest of the page from loading until the script is done.

// 2. async Attribute

{/* <script src="script.js" async></script> */}

// The script file is downloaded asynchronously (in parallel) while the HTML is being parsed.
// Once the script is downloaded, it is executed immediately (before the HTML parsing completes).
// Execution is not ordered: if multiple async scripts are used, they will run as soon as they finish downloading, 
// which may cause issues if one script relies on another.

// When to Use async
// Use async for scripts that are independent of other scripts or DOM content, such as analytics, tracking scripts, or third-party services.
// Good for scripts that donâ€™t rely on other scripts or DOM elements being fully loaded.

// 3. defer Attribute

{/* <script src="script.js" defer></script> */}

// The script file is also downloaded asynchronously while the HTML is being parsed.
// However, the script is executed after the HTML parsing is fully complete (i.e., after the DOM is fully constructed).
// Execution order is preserved: if multiple defer scripts are included, they will execute in the 
// order they appear in the document.


// When to Use defer:
// Use defer for scripts that rely on the DOM being fully parsed before they execute, such as 
// scripts that manipulate DOM elements or rely on other scripts.
// Ideal for most scripts that affect the page content, such as those controlling interactivity or 
// loading content dynamically.


// Summary
// async: Scripts load in parallel and execute as soon as they are ready (non-blocking), but without guaranteed execution order.
// defer: Scripts load in parallel, but they execute only after the HTML parsing is complete and in the order they are defined.
